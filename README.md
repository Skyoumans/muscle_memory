# Muscle Memory
## A muscle-builing tracking application

## About

This is Muscle Memory, my final project application 

designed to assist on your journey to weight loss or 

gain  and build muscle.  Muscle Memory keeps track of 

your progress buy allowing you to update your muscle 

size and weight loss. You can also start workout 

sessions with pre made session types or create one of 

your own!

    

## Motivation

This is an application I have been looking for online

and I've never found one before.  Having this app 

would allow me to actually track progress and stay 
    
motivated in the process.



## Trials and Tribulations

I am ashamed to say that this project really made me 
  
question myself as a developer. It was my most 
  
ambitious project to date and I think that intimidated 

me. There were several times I just had to stop and 

put my head on the desk and try not to freak out. Along 

with the countless issues my personal life tossed at me, 

I never came close to where I wanted to be after this 

week.

    syndrome
